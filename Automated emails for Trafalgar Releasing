  var body = "Dear Trafalgar Releasing, <br><br> I hope this e-mail finds you well. I am emailing your company as a fan of Agust D/SUGA of BTS to let it be known that I and many others will not be watching the movie because of the decision to screen in Israel. <br><br> For months now, and for decades before, the Israeli occupation has been committing extremely devastating and violent attacks on Palestine. Multiple experts, humanitarian organizations and countries have concluded that these actions being carried out by Israel are tantamount to genocide. Attacks on civilians, forced starvation, and other atrocities have contributed to a death toll of over 31,000 since October 2023. <br><br> It makes us incredibly sad not to attend any screenings, as all of us were really looking forward to the D-DAY movie. However, we cannot in good conscience support this financially while innocent people, including thousands of kids and babies, have been killed and are continuously being starved, bombed and dehumanized, and while knowing one of the factors that allows Israel to get away with their multiple war crimes is this normalization of Zionism. <br><br> If Russia is not on the screening list of locations due to their attacks on Ukraine, then it is extremely hypocritical to allow this movie to be screened in Israel. We urge you to reconsider where you have authorized this movie to be shown, to do the right thing and cancel the screenings in Israel. If not, hundreds of fans from across the globe will be boycotting any screenings. <br><br> Thank you for your attention. <br><br> Regards,<br><br>"+name+"<br>";
